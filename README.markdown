Chroma-Hash
===========

## A sexy, non-reversable live visualization of password field input

*In a tweet*: Chroma-Hash is a jQuery plugin that dynamically visualizes secure text-field values using ambient color bars

Password entry can be frustrating, especially with long or difficult passwords. On a webpage, secure fields obscure your input with •'s, so others can't read it. Unfortunately, neither can you—you can't tell if you got your password right until you click "Log In". 

Chroma-Hash displays a series of colored bars at the end of field inputs so you can instantly see if your password is right. Chroma-Hash takes an MD5 hash of your input and uses that to compute the colors in the visualization. The MD5 hash is non-reversible, so no one could know what your password just from the colors. Your password will display the same sequence each time, so you can learn to expect "blue, red, pink", for instance; if you instead see "green, purple, yellow", you'll know you typed it wrong.
